 DETS
Deep East Texas Security - 'Punzel out Cat (PoC), Bluetooth sniffing and spoofing 
Bluetooth Sniffing and Spoofing
with ‘Punzel our Cat (PoC)
Intended Audience – anyone with interest in Bluetooth, Wifi, R Pi, Cats.

Many examples are Linux based. ~Most apply equally well to Windows.

A familiarity with Wireshark and Metasploit is a head start but this is a good chance to try them out for the first time as well (both can be used for ~hands on if installed)

No bluetooth device needed, but if you have an ~ubertooth...bring it.

No cats were harmed in the production of this presentation, though many  were annoyed.
